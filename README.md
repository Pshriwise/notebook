This is an almost minimal blog template. I've added Mathjax support for
rendering Latex and I've added some search functionality.

Dependencies
============

Jekyll of course, which you can get with

```
gem install jekyll
```

Get Started
===========

Update the Gravatar URL in `_config.yml` to your preferred picture and serve it up with
